## About
Full-Stack e-commerce website developed with Next.JS. It was a challenging yet rewarding journey to learn many new principles and technologies for Full-Stack development. The project served as my introduction to Next.JS, TypeScript and Tailwind CSS, allowing me to learn multiple useful skills while developing a project of which I deeply care about. The brand of which the website is based is a ficticious clothing brand developed by myself as a Graphic Design exercise. The web application has been deployed thorugh Vercel, making it available for anyone to test. [Click here to go to the e-commerce web app](https://jumping-esquilo-ecommerce.vercel.app/)
